        <h1>Für Elise</h1>
        <h3>Ludwig van Beethoven</h3>
        <p>"Für Elise" is a famous piano piece composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810. Officially titled Bagatelle No.
            25 in A minor, it is one of his most well-known and beloved works. The piece features a light, lyrical main
            theme that contrasts with more dramatic sections. The music is often associated with romantic feelings and
            is commonly played by both beginner and advanced pianists.</p>

        <h1>History of the Piano</h1>
        <p>
            The piano was invented around 1700 by Bartolomeo Cristofori in Italy. Unlike the harpsichord, which plucked strings,
            the piano used hammers to strike them, enabling dynamic volume control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, the piano evolved into the grand and upright forms we recognize today. It became central to classical
            music and later expanded into jazz, pop, and modern genres. Composers like Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and many more
            contributed to its rise as a dominant instrument in Western music.

        <h1>Learning Piano Notes</h1>
        <p>
            The piano keyboard is made up of white and black keys. Each key represents a musical note. The white keys follow the pattern:
            A, B, C, D, E, F, G and then repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The black keys are grouped in sets of twos and threes. Each black key is either a sharp (#) or flat (♭) note. For example, the black key after C is called C# (or D♭).
        </p>
        <p>
            The note C is usually found just before the group of two black keys. Try to find and play all the C notes on the keyboard to start getting familiar!
